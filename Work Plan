This is the workflow 

1. We would have a total of 5 Notebooks 

a) First = Cleaning of Data 

b) Second = EDA 

c) Third = Machine Learning Model 1

d) Fourth = Machine Learning Model 2

e) Fifth = Insights 

Since we are breaking up into 5 books, inorder for the data to be carried over, we would convert the data at the end of the file into a Pickle File
